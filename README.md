# Infinite-X

Infinite-X is an open-source repository of experiments aimed at advancing AI reasoning towards superintelligence. Although the project is currently in its early stages, we have outlined a roadmap that details the most important explicit techniques and methods with algorithmic overviews that hold the potential to advance AI reasoning to the next level. Our goal is to explore and experiment with these techniques in collaboration with the open-source community to create the foundation of future AI systems.

## Techniques Roadmap
The roadmap consists of several key techniques that we believe have the potential to advance AI reasoning. Each technique includes a brief algorithmic overview and will be explored in-depth as the project progresses.

1. **Chain of Thought**
    - Algorithmic Overview: Implement a recursive process that allows the AI to generate multiple levels of abstraction by chaining together thoughts, ultimately leading to more complex reasoning and decision-making.

2. **Human Reinforcement Learning**
    - Algorithmic Overview: Develop an AI model that is capable of learning from human feedback by incorporating reinforcement learning techniques. This involves creating a reward function based on human preferences and training the AI to optimize for those preferences.

3. **Constitutional AI**
    - Algorithmic Overview: Design AI systems with predefined ethical and legal principles, which guide their reasoning and decision-making processes. This involves encoding these principles into the AI's architecture and continuously refining them as the system learns.

4. **Dynamic Episodic Memory**
    - Algorithmic Overview: Implement a memory system that allows the AI to store and retrieve episodic information dynamically, enabling it to learn from past experiences and apply that knowledge to new situations.

5. **Causal Inference & Counterfactual Reasoning**
    - Algorithmic Overview: Develop AI systems that can infer causal relationships from data and reason about counterfactuals, enabling them to make better predictions and decisions in complex environments.

## Getting Started
As Infinite-X is in its early stages, the project is primarily focused on research and development. Please refer to our [Wiki](https://github.com/Infinite-X/Infinite-X/wiki) for more information about each technique, and join our [Discussions](https://github.com/Infinite-X/Infinite-X/discussions) to engage with the community.
